# Introduction
Today I started learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

EDA is the process where I explore and understand my dataset before applying any machine learning model. In this step, I examine the structure of the data, check summary statistics, visualize distributions, and analyze relationships between variables. EDA helps me detect patterns, identify outliers, and understand how different features interact with each other. It is an important step because it ensures that my data is clean, meaningful, and ready for further analysis or modeling.
