# Numpy : Basic to Advance Level

## Introduction

NumPy is a core Python library for numerical computing, built for handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.

# Array Manipulation
Creating NumPy arrays is a fundamental aspect of working with numerical data in Python.NumPy provides various methods to create arrays efficiently, catering to different needs and scenarios. 

NumPy provides several built-in functions to generate arrays with specific properties.

- np.zeros(): Creates an array filled with zeros.
- np.ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.
- np.full(): Creates an array filled with a specified value.
- np.arange(): Creates an array with values that are evenly spaced within a given range.
- np.linspace(): Creates an array with values that are evenly spaced over a specified interval.

## Simple Program of above function:

# Create Python Numpy Arrays Using Random Number Generation
NumPy provides functions to create arrays filled with random numbers.

- np.random.rand(): Creates an array of specified shape and fills it with random values sampled from a uniform distribution over [0, 1).
- np.random.randn(): Creates an array of specified shape and fills it with random values sampled from a standard normal distribution.
- np.random.randint(): Creates an array of specified shape and fills it with random integers within a given range.

# Create Python Numpy Arrays Using Matrix Creation Routines
NumPy provides functions to create specific types of matrices.

np.eye(): Creates an identity matrix of specified size.
- np.diag(): Constructs a diagonal array.
- np.zeros_like(): Creates an array of zeros with the same shape and type as a given array.
- np.ones_like(): Creates an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given array.
