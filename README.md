## Day 001 : Data Distribution using python

Today i learn about the concept of data distribution and some of it's examples .  Data distribution show how data values are spread out and it helps in :

- Detect outliers
- See if your data is balanced or skewed
- Decide whether you need normalization or transformation
- Detect imbalanced classes in classification problems

I've use  python module Numpy, where we can create random data sets of any size.

## Day 002 : Visualizing Data Distribution using python

Today i learn about how to visualize the distributed data . 


## 📈 Visualization Types


###  Histogram
A **histogram** shows how data is distributed by grouping values into bins.
We will use the Python module Matplotlib to draw a histogram.
# sample example of histogram:
<img width="846" height="702" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccce542b-ba96-441a-b9a3-e128832cc591" />



##  Normal Distribution 

A **normal distribution** is characterized by:
- A **mean (μ)** — the center of the curve  
- A **standard deviation (σ)** — controls how spread out the data is  

The formula for the probability density function is:

A Probability Density Function (PDF) is a mathematical function that tells you how likely a continuous outcome (like height, time, or temperature) is to fall within a certain range.

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

# Simple example of visualizing noram distribution:

##  scatter plot
A scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot.
<img width="640" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/168d08ea-cf6f-43cb-aa75-625004600152" />

The Matplotlib module has a method for drawing scatter plots, it needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for the values of the y-axis:
- x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
- y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

Use the scatter() method to draw a scatter plot diagram.

# Simple example of scatter plot :

## Random Data Distributions
In Machine Learning the data sets can contain thousands-, or even millions, of values.
You might not have real world data when you are testing an algorithm, you might have to use randomly generated values.

Let us create two arrays that are both filled with 1000 random numbers from a normal data distribution.
The first array will have the mean set to 5.0 with a standard deviation of 1.0.
The second array will have the mean set to 10.0 with a standard deviation of 2.0:
